You are given a binary tree, you need to print the average of each level of the tree.

Note - You have to complete findAverageLevel() function, no need to implement the tree.

Input format
The root of the tree is passed to the findAverageLevel().
And the tree is constructed in level order format.

Output format
Print the average of each level of the tree(with 2 decimal digits precision) separated by space.

Constraints
1<=N<=40

Time Limit
1 second

Example
Input
9 7 5 2 -1 -1 -1 -1 3 -1 -1 

Note - Level order traversal of input tree, where âˆ’1 represents null nodes.

Output
9.00 6.00 2.00 3.00

Sample Test case Explanation
Level 1 : 
9 is root, so 9/1 = 9

Level 2 : (7+5)/2=6

Level 3 : 2/1 = 2

Level 4 : 3/1 =3
