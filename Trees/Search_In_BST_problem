Given a binary search tree and a key, return the node if it exist in the tree, else return NULL.

Note - You have to complete searchInBST() function, no need to implement the tree.

Input format
Root of the tree is passed to the searchInBST()
And the tree is constructed in level order format.

Output format
Return the node if it exist in the tree, else return NULL.

Constraints 1 <= N <= 64

Example
Input
4 3 6 1 -1 5 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
5

Note : Level order traversal of input tree, where âˆ’1 represents null nodes.

Output
Yes
