Raju is researching about different kinds of mammals and their ancestors. He has assigned a unique integer number to each mammal and has arranged them in a binary search tree format. He needs your help to create a program that outputs lowest common ancestor of two mammals.

Note -

You have to complete findLowestAncestor() function, no need to implement the tree.
Lowest common ancestor of two node n1 and n2 is the lowest node in the tree that has both n1 and n2 as descendents(where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
Input format
The root of the tree and two integers representing the mammals are passed to the findLowestAncestor().
And the tree is constructed in level order format.

Output format
Return the lowest common ancestor node of the given mammals.



Note:

The code contains only functional part only
